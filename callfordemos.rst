Call for Abstracts!
+++++++++++++++++++

HPPSS is accepting submissions for talks that demonstrate the application of a technology that greatly enhance the
performance and capability of Python at scale. Technologies that are applicable to a wide range of use-cases and
accessible to a broad user base are of particular interest. Showing technologies applied to specific use-cases can be
very helpful for the audience's understanding, but be sure to show and discuss how they generalize.

Note that submissions will not be included in the SC proceedings. The purpose of the review process are to help us plan
the event and provide feedback to submitters. Our intention is that this makes it easier for submitters and we get a
broader engagement from the community. We plan to provide links to submissions through the HPPSS GitHub and website.


Important Dates
===============

* Submission opens: July 14, 2025
* Abstract submission deadline: September 15, 2025
* Decisions: September 22, 2025
* SC25 conference: November 16-21, 2025
* HPPSS half-day workshop: afternoon of November 17th, 2-5:30 CST


Interest Areas
==============

Submissions in the following areas are well-suited for HPPSS:

* Python for accelerated computing at scale
* Programming of federated/distributed workflows
* Data management between Python libraries, processes, and storage
* Performance via intelligent data management across memory hierarchies
* High-bandwidth/low-latency network performance for Python
* Multi-processing for on-node and off-node configurations
* Program execution including parallelization and asynchronous communication

One focus area for this year is **observability**. Understanding progress, performance, and bottlenecks for dynamic
Python workloads is challenging. We welcome submissions that include insights, tools, and use cases that focus on
understanding "what is going on?" with Python at scale.


How to Submit
=============

Abstract Submission
-------------------

.. |HPPSSemail| raw:: html

   <a href="mailto:hppss@pyhpc.org" target="_blank">hppss@pyhpc.org</a>

We are using a simplified submission process this year. Each presentation submission must include:

* short abstract (less than 100 words),
* presentation description (less than 500 words),
* links to other relevant material (e.g., demo recording, code, documentation, plots, etc)
* speaker bio.

Reviews will focus on the presentation description. External links can be used to enhance the description and are a
chance to give additional context and preview of your talk.

**Submit abstracts via email to** |HPPSSemail| **by the end of the day (AoE) 9/15/2025.**


Optional Demo Video
-------------------

Video recordings of demos should be submitted through Zenodo. Submitted recordings should include audio commentary
describing the demo and what is being shown. Submissions accepted to the conference will have an opportunity to produce
an updated video that should not include commentary. The presenter should be prepared to describe the demo video as part
of their presentation (ie don't just play the video and say nothing).

We have created a Zenodo [1]_ community: `HPPSS – Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/hppss>`__ for contributors to
upload their video submissions for the workshop.
